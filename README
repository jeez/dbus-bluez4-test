## SUMMARY ##
A very simple and quick test to make sure a user can access
the DBUS System Bus and query something.

## BUILD ##
g++ -o dbus-bluez4-test `pkg-config --cflags --libs gio-2.0` dbus-bluez4-test.cc

## GENERATE PACKAGE ##
gbs build -A i586

## DESCRIBING THE BUG on TIZEN 2.x ##
Summary: I can't get any code that use the DBUS System BUS to work properly.
Or at least not without giving 'w' (write) access from my SMACK label to the "_" (floor) label.
Since the floor label is the system's label, that is unacceptable.

After installing this you can just run it with "/usr/bin/dbus-bluez4-test".

If you run it as 'root' you will see:
"Starting BlueZ4 SystemBus test"
"Got DefaultAdapter Path: /org/bluez/513/hci0"

If you run it as any other user (app) you will see:
"Starting BlueZ4 SystemBus test"
"## Manager Proxy creation error: Could not connect: Permission denied"


After running as app, I go back to the root user and run "dmesg | grep -i smack". That gives me:

"[62891.260650] type=1400 audit(1388706251.319:31254): lsm=SMACK fn=smack_unix_stream_connect action=denied subject=\"dbus-bluez4-test\" object=\"_\" requested=w pid=1825 comm=\"pool\" path=\"/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket"


So, in summary, SMACK is telling me that my label "dbus-bluez4-test" tried to write to the label "_", which is not permitted. It also tells me that it has something to do with "/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket". Funny enough, If I check this path's smack label with "chsmack /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket", it tells that its access label is "*", which should give me full access to it.

It looks like it should have something to do with the DBUS System label being under the "_" SMACK label, but that wouldn't make much sense, right?
